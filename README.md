#AWS Instance Availability Spreadsheet Generator

This is a quick-and-dirty script to generate a spreadsheet populated with instance types available in each region.  It is sloppy and incomplete. Currently only linux instance types are displayed with no pre-installed software (no SQL Server, etc).  **Data has been spot checked but has not been thoroughly verified to be correct.  Use at your own risk.**
